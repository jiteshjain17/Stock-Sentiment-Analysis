# Stock-Sentiment-Analysis
Worked on a dataset consisting of a combination of the world news and stock price shifts. There are 25 columns of top news headlines for each day in the data frame. Built a model which predicts whether the stock price of the company will increase, remain same or decrease. 

<b>Approach:</b>
 - Used Bag of Words and TF-IDF for extracting features from the headlines.
